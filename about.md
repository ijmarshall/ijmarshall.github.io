My name is Iain Marshall. I'm a GP/family physician in south London, and MRC fellow in health informatics based at King's College London, in the School of Population Health and Environmental Sciences. I am particularly intereted in making health evidence easier to use (through better design) and more efficient (with computers!).

# Research overview

My research is around evidence based medicine and research synthesis, and specifically how to help patients and doctors make most efficient use of the health research. I gained my PhD in Public Health from King's in 2016, with a thesis on the topic of '[Evidence based medicine and the patient](https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/evidencebased-medicine-and-the-patientthe-example-of-cardiovascular-disease-prevention(ef1297fe-7b0f-419d-8e33-04141cc27744).html)'. 

I am the co-lead of the [RobotReviewer](https://www.robotreviewer.net) project, together with [Byron Wallace](http://www.byronwallace.com/) at Northeastern, Boston. RobotReviewer is an artificial intelligence (AI) system which automatically extracts useful data from clinical trial reports, including on biases, study design, and characteristics of the population, interventions, and outcomes (the *PICO*). We also produce [RobotSearch](https://robotsearch.vortext.systems), which is a state-of-the-art AI system for automatically finding RCTs.
